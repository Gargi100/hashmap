                <pre>Origins of the Essay
                    Over the course of more than six centuries
                     essays were used to question assumptions, argue trivial opinions 
                     and to initiate global discussions. Let’s have a closer look into 
                     historical progress and various applications of this literary phenomenon to find out exactly what it is.
                     Today’s modern word “essay” can trace its roots back to the 
                     French “essayer” which translates closely to mean “to attempt”.  
                     This is an apt name for this writing form because the essay’s ultimate purpose is to 
                     attempt to convince the audience of something.  An essay’s topic can range broadly and 
                     include everything from the best of Shakespeare’s plays to the joys of April.
                    
                    The essay comes in many shapes and sizes; it can focus on a personal experience or a purely 
                    academic exploration of a topic.  Essays are classified as a subjective writing form because while 
                    they include expository elements, they can rely on personal narratives to support the writer’s viewpoint.
                      The essay genre includes a diverse array of academic writings ranging from literary criticism to meditations
                       on the natural world.  Most typically, the essay exists as a shorter writing form; essays are rarely the
                        length of a novel.  However, several historic examples, such as John Locke’s seminal work “An Essay 
                        Concerning Human Understanding” just shows that a well-organized essay can be as long as a novel.
                    
                    The Essay in Literature
                    The essay enjoys a long and renowned history in literature. 
                     They first began gaining in popularity in the early 16th century,
                      and their popularity has continued today both with original writers
                       and ghost writers.  Many readers prefer this short form in which the
                        writer seems to speak directly to the reader, presenting a particular 
                        claim and working to defend it through a variety of means.  Not sure if
                         you’ve ever read a great essay? You wouldn’t believe how many pieces of
                          literature are actually nothing less than essays, or evolved into more 
                          complex structures from the essay. Check out this list of literary favorites:</pre>
