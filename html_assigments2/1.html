        <div><h1><b>Paragraphs & Topic Sentences</b></h1></div>
        <div>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single
            topic.
            Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into
            paragraphs.
            This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help the
            reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.</div>
        <div><h3>TOPIC SENTENCES</h3></div>
        <div>A well-organized paragraph supports or develops a single controlling idea, which is expressed in a sentence
            called the topic sentence. A topic sentence has several important functions: it substantiates or supports an
            essay’s thesis statement; it unifies the content of a paragraph and directs the order of the sentences; and
            it advises the reader of the subject to be discussed and how the paragraph will discuss it. Readers
            generally look to the first few sentences in a paragraph to determine the subject and perspective of the
            paragraph. That’s why it’s often best to put the topic sentence at the very beginning of the paragraph. In
            some cases, however, it’s more effective to place another sentence before the topic sentence—for example, a
            sentence linking the current paragraph to the previous one, or one providing background information.</div>
